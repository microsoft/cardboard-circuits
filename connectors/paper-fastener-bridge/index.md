# Fasterner-brige connectors

Paper fasteners allow to cramp on metal legs from resistors, diodes and other electronic components. They are very useful to create a small ad-hoc circuit involving resistors or LEDs.

> You can also use paper fasteners to hide connections under the cardboard [as described in this instructable](http://www.instructables.com/id/Build-a-Simple-Circuit-from-a-Pizza-Box-No-Solder/)

## Make

### Step 1: punch the cardboard

Use a hole puncher and _very carefully_ scissors to punch a hole for the paper fasterner.

### Step 2: connect the cables

Slide the cables in between the legs of the fasterner and secure it in the hole

### Step 3: complete the circuit

Complete the circuit with a binder clip or another faster!
