# Controllers

![Controller modules]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/controller.jpg)

A **controller** module has integrate behavior to relate **inputs** to **outputs**. A controller may be built out of simple electronic components and/or microcontrollers. 

Microcontrollers are tiny computers that receive and generate electrical currents. They can be used to control motors, lights and sounds.
Some microcontrollers have built-in sensors and buttons which makes even easier to integrate them in your project. 
We will use microcontrollers supported by https://makecode.com in this guide but there are many others out there.

The module color is **yellow** for controllers. For controllers you can also overlay more colors to denote their capabilities.
