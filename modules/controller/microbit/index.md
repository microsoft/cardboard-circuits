A [micro:bit](https://makecode.microbit.org) is a small computer, called _microcontroller_, 
that can interact with other electronic devices. Aside from the onboard screen, sensors and radio capabilities, the micro:bit can control LEDs, servos or motor controllers via large hole connector on the bottom. The micro:bit is easily programmed with a [kid frienly code editor](https://makecode.microbit.org).

## Don't fry me!

Do not plug DC motors directly into the micro:bit. The pins on the edge connector are designed for small current and driving large motor would surely damaged your board!
