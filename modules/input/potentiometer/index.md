# Potentiometer

A potentiometer controls the voltage going through each circuit, it acts a voltage divider between two circuits.

## What can go wrong?

A potentiometer acts as a voltage dividing resitor. If large current are flowing via the resistor, it will start to heat up and potentially break down.
