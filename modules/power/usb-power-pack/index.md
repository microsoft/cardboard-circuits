#### USB power pack

USB power packs are fairly inexpensive, easy to charge and have integrate protections (check the manual) which makes them a great choice to build circuits. In order to tap in the 5V power, you will need to cut open a USB cable and connect the ground/positive cables to binder clip
connections.

Some battery packs automatically shut down when no current is drawn, so this solution might not work for low current makes. In most cases, if a motor is involved, you won't face that problem!

* Using a wire cutter, cut open a USB cable.
* Trim the red and black cables and cut out the rest of the cables.

* Connect the cables using cable-binders connection.
* Mark each connection with their polarity using a marker. Use the correct color, it helps!
* Glue the battery to the cardboard to finish the module
