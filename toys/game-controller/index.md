# Game Controller

A typical game controller is stuffed with buttons, vibrators
and other cools sensors. To open it up, you would typically need
a small Phillips screwdriver.

## Parts

With a bit of luck, you will get the following parts:

* 2 [DC vibrating motors]({{site.baseurl}}/modules/output/dc-vibrating-motor)
* 1 [cable]({{site.baseurl}}/modules/wire/cable)

## Make

* Cut out the cable and turn it into a [cable module]({{site.baseurl}}/modules/wire/cable).

* If the controller has a "vibrate" feature and you'll find 2 DC motors in the handles. Remove them trying keep as much cable as possible and turn them into [vibrating modules]({{site.baseurl}}/modules/output/dc-vibrating-motor).
